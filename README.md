# Cognite Bootcamp: Ice Cream DataOps

Welcome to the Cognite Bootcamp repository! This project demonstrates how to use Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) tools end-to-end, covering the full data journey from onboarding to advanced analytics and orchestration.

## Overview

This bootcamp guides you through:
- **Data Onboarding:** Connect to the Ice Cream API and ingest data into CDF.
- **Data Contextualization:** Link assets with timeseries data to create a contextualized digital representation.
- **OEE Calculation:** Define and compute Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) using CDF capabilities.
- **Orchestration:** Automate data workflows using CDF Workflows for seamless data operations.
- **Industrial Tools:** Leverage CDFâ€™s industrial data tools for advanced analytics and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install the latest version of the [Cognite Python SDK](https://cognite-sdk-python.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/).
- Ensure you have a valid CDF `.toml` configuration file with your project and authentication details.
- Also make sure before we dploy to prod we setup the `cognite_toolkit_service_principal` for prod environment.

## Key Modules

- **Data Ingestion:** Scripts and configs to onboard data from the Ice Cream API.
- **Transformations:** Contextualize assets and timeseries, and perform OEE calculations.
- **Workflows:** Orchestrate data pipelines and automate processes using CDF Workflows.
